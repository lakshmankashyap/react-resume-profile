                I am always striving to be broaden my knowledge and sharpen my skills. I love working in
                environment with lots of challenges and brilliant people to share those challenges with. I am very
                passionate about programming. I have keen eye for new paradigms and architecture. Though I am
                comfortable in one language, I also like to explore new languages. I also like indulging my time with
                my pet projects and participating in hackathons also i like to stay updated with the latest
                technologies.
